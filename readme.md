### Introduction 

We have implemented a distributed database, complete with multiversion concurrency control, deadlock detection, replication, and failure recovery with data as mentioned in the project specification. We have used the available copies algorithm  approach to replication using strict two phase locking (using read and write locks) at each site and validation at commit time. Read-only transactions have been implemented using multiversion read consistency. We have also implemented to detect deadlocks using cycle detection and abort the youngest transaction in the cycle, if there is any deadlock detected.

### Running

At the root of the project, run 

```
$ python3 driver.py <input_file_path>
``` 

Sample Inputs:

Note : The input file should not have any empty lines.
``` 
//Sample Input 1
// All should commit
begin(T1)
begin(T2)
R(T1,x2)
R(T2,x2)
W(T2,x2,10)
end(T1)
end(T2)
```

```
//Sample Input 2
// T3 must wait till the commit of T2 before it reads x4
// (because of locking), so sees 44.
// T3 must abort though because the lock information is lost on site 4 
// upon failure
// T1 reads the initial value of x2 because T3 has aborted.
begin(T3)
begin(T1)
begin(T2)
W(T3,x2,22)
W(T2,x3,44)
R(T3,x3)
end(T2)
fail(4)
end(T3)
R(T1,x2)
end(T1)
```

## Data Models

Below are the Data Models used in the Project to build a distributed database system.

```python
class Variable:

    def __init__(self, name, val, lock, replicated = False):
 
        self.name = name
        self.val = val
        self.lock = lock
        self.commited_value = val
        self.commited_time = 0
        self.replicated = replicated
        self.readable = True
        self.version_history = {0:val} #dict of time and val
```

```python
class Site:

    def __init__(self,name, status, vars):

        self.name = name
        self.status = status
        self.variables = vars #dict of var name and var obj
        self.lock_table = defaultdict(list) # dict of var name and list of locks
```


```python

        self.start_time = start_time
        self.read_only = read_only
        self.sites_accessed = set()

```

```python
